1) Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables would you need to combine?

I believe all you would need is origin, destination, and tail number. All of these variables are in flights, so you don't need to combine tables?

2)I forgot to draw the relationship between weather and airports. What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?

The relationships is origin (weather) and the faa code (airports), on the diagram it would appear as a double arrow line connecting weather and airports?

3)weather only contains information for the origin (NYC) airports. If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional relation would it define with flights?
Since all flights are from NY ariports to other US airports, to have weather obs for all airports we would also need a dest column.
